# Rustle
Rustle is a learning project designed to help me get more familiar with Rust. It aims to be a simple yet powerful task automation tool, inspired by tools like Ansible but with a focus on being lightweight and user-friendly.

## Status

### MVP
- [ ] CLI for task automation
- [ ] TOML-based task configuration
